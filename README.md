# Brian B

I am a full stack web developer building tools for personal sovereignty.

Nomadic intellectualism has led me winding through many lives: I've been a teacher (pre-K, college) and a soap maker, a hotel manager and a small business manager. I'm a runner and a guitar player.

In addition to plain curiosity, a central motivation for this has always been simply seeking what it means to live a good life. It is clear we can no longer ignore certain novelties of modernity, forces that would have us punt on seeking the good in exchange for infinite scrolling: hyper-stimulation, garbage media, predatory consumer tech, etc. You know what I'm talking about.

Now my basecamp is web development. It is exhilarating and empowering, and a stepping stone on a path toward a vision. I'm taking back my computing, taking back my tech.

Join me across the new frontier.
